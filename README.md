# What is this?

Temporary middle-man type server just to get the DID and PII stuff going


"""

- BC atm just stores the DID and serves VC upon successful DID Issues
- Forward PII sent from dashboard to the BC

  - Use a very basic DB to store PII hashes that were used to generate the DID
- Forward VC requests to the BC
